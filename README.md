# Gmod-Workshop-Downloader
A "simple" batch script that will download Garry's Mod workshop items. Since this is a batch file, this method only works on windows. I tried posting this on reddit 5 months ago but it never got posted because it was marked as spam for whatever reason, so I figured I'd post it here for everyone to use. Hopefully some get use out of this. I know something like this has prob already been made, but I still prefer mine 1000%, I don't think I've seen anything like it before, and I'm kinda proud of the work I've put into it.

1. [Download SteamCMD](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip) and extract it into a folder.
2. Find your Garry's Mod directory by right-clicking on the game in Steam, selecting "Manage" and then "Browse local files".
3. In the "Bin" folder, find a file named "gmad.exe" and copy it into the same folder as SteamCMD.
4. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/kevdaawsome/Gmod-Workshop-Downloader/releases) and put it in the same folder as SteamCMD and gmad.exe.
5. Run the script and paste the Workshop ID of the Garry's Mod addon you want to download. To get the Workshop ID, right-click on the addon's Steam Workshop page and select "Copy link address".
6. The script will download the addon and extract it to the same folder as SteamCMD and gmad.exe. If the download is successful, the folder will open automatically.
7. Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded your desired Garry's Mod addon.
